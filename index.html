<h2>Fruit smell</h2>
<p>
    How to smell
Experts never smell the base of the durian. Mr Goh Kwee Leng, 58, owner of 717 Trading, says: "The base of the husk is the thickest part so it is harder to smell the aroma of the fruit."
<br><br><br><br>
Instead, sniff along the seams or split lines of the durian - you should smell a slight fragrance. If there is no aroma, the durian is unripe. If the aroma is too strong, the durian is probably over-ripe.
<br><br><br><br>
The right shape
The best durians are oval or slightly oblong in shape. Odd-shaped fruit are likely to have fewer chambers inside and so fewer flesh-covered seeds.

<h2>Fruit Size and taste</h2>
<p>
    Size matters
    Different varieties of durians come in different sizes. For example, XO durians are generally smaller while there are no small Red Prawn durians - these are generally large fruit. So be suspicious if a seller points to a large XO durian or a small Red Prawn one.
    <br><br><br><br>
    Trick of the trade
    Some sellers try to push durians that have been rejected by other customers. Watch the vendors to ensure that they are opening a new durian.
    <br><br><br><br>
    Taste test
    Instead of prodding the flesh-covered seeds when the seller presents an open fruit, customers should taste the durian. If it is bad, or not the variety promised, they are not obliged to buy it, sellers say.

    <h2>Price & more</h2>
    <p>
        <b>The real deal</b>
        To make sure a seller isn't passing off a lesser durian as a Mao Shan Wang, look for prominent seams radiating from the base of the durian. The seams are lines where the spikes of the durian run parallel to each other. The base of a real D24 durian has a flat round spot about half the size of a 5-cent coin.
